# RCV - Repair & Clean

I created this because I didn't find an _repair_ and _clean_ resource. It's a pretty simple resource, though the config is wide.
I've also made a translations.lua, where you can change all messages that are promted to the user. This makes it really easy configurable for your taste.

The config is very simple yet wide. You can change which commands should be created, and who will be able to use them.

## Features:

There's 3 commands, repair, clean and fix.

**/repair** - Repairs the vehicle, works if you're inside the vehicle or close to it.

**/clean** - Cleans the vehicle, works if you're inside the vehicle or close to it.

**/fix** - Repairs and cleans the vehicle, works if you're inside the vehicle or close to it.

### Installation

1. Download the resource, put it in either your root directory or perhaps a "script" directory, you choose.
2. Change the name to RCV and ensure/start it from the server.cfg.
3. Edit the config and translations to your liking, and restart the server.
4. Enjoy!

#### No dependencies required.
